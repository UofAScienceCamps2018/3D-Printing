Now it is time for you to create a design on your own that will be 3D printed and given to you on Friday.

## Thinking in 3d ##

#### Discuss creating a 3d object: ####
Before making something it is important to think about how the object is created in 3d space. Have an object in your mind that you want to build so that you can break that object down piece by piece (or shape). Put it together piece by piece and you will do great.

Either on the board or with an already created 3d object dissect the simple parts (or shapes) need to make this object. For example: A simple rocket model could be made with a nose cone (paraboloid), a body (cylinder), fins (triangles), window (oval or sphere).

#### Adding Objects ####
Have students select some basic geometric shapes. Have them pick their favorite and drag it onto the workplane. The object is not placed until the left click is released. Have students click and drag several shapes so they can get used to adding objects to their work-plane. 
 
#### Altering Shapes ####
#### `delete` ####
First way to alter a shape is to delete, left click to select and press delete on the keyboard or in the Edit menu selecting delete. Remind students they can undo if they accidently alter a shape in a way they do not like.
#### `move` ####
The second way you can alter a shape is by left clicking on an object and dragging to move it on the grid keeping the left button clicked. 
#### `resize` ####
The third way we can change a shape is to select it and click and drag either the black or white boxes. The black boxes only resize one dimension (height, width or length) and the white boxes change multiple dimensions at once. As you are resizing the object you can see the dimensions in millimeters this is importance for reference especially if you are going to be 3d printing you model later. 
 #### `rotate` ####
Finally, you can rotate objects by clicking on the arrows and moving on the inside or outside of the rotation circle depending whether you want it locked to a rotation grid.


#### Exporting Design for printing ####

1.Click the name of the design on the top left and rename it with your name. 

2.Click export on the top right handside above the editor

3.Export it as .STL and download should start 

4.[Open google drive folder and sign in](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tdau8vbwhphM_yG9qajGRa6sAmo78F5H)

5.Upload the .STL file you downloaded and confirm your name is in the name of the file.
